The difference with the classical mathematical programming methods is that the objective function (which is the function to be minimized or maximized) is not known explicitly and is defined by the simulation model (computer code). The course will demonstrate multiple approaches to build simulation models, such as discrete event simulations and agent-based simulations. Then, it will show how stochastic optimization and heuristic approaches can be used to analyze the simulated system and design a sequence of computational experiments that allow to develop a basic understanding of a particular simulation model or system through exploration of the parameter space, to find robust plausible behaviors and conditions and robust near-optimal solutions that are not prone to being unstable under small perturbations.","id":63}

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems.

Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.","id":808}
