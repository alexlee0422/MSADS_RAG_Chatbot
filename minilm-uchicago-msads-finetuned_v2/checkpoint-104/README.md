  | <code>What statistical models are covered in the University of Chicago's MS in Applied Data Science program, specifically in relation to the "Linear Normal" assumption commonly used in statistics/data science for almost two centuries?</code> | <code>Course: Unknown Course<br>Description: In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.<br>Details:<br>• Statistical Models for Data Science Letter Grade In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of th...</code> |
